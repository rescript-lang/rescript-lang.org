# Translations
The ReScript project is exclusively curated in English and our documentation platform is still in the shaping process. 
We currently don't have plans introducing i18n / translation features just yet. 
We welcome any community efforts to translate our resources. Please make sure to follow SEO best practises and most importantly, 
add [canonical](https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization) references to point to the original source, otherwise we might get mixed results with SEO / google search. 
When in doubt, please reach out to us [in the forum](https://forum.rescript-lang.org).
