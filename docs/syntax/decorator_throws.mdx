summary: "This is the `@throws` decorator."
category: "decorators"

> This decorator requires [`reanalyze`](https://github.com/rescript-lang/reanalyze), a code analysis tool for ReScript, to be installed. [Click here to read about how you get started with reanalyze.](/docs/manual/v12.0.0/editor-plugins#code-analysis).

`@throws` is picked up by reanalyze's exception analysis, and acknowledges that a function can throw exceptions that are not caught, and suppresses a warning in that case. Callers of the functions are then subjected to the same rule. Example `@throws(Exn)` or `@throws([E1, E2, E3])` for multiple exceptions.
