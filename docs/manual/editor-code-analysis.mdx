# Dead Code Analysis in ReScript

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on how to leverage ReScript’s powerful dead code analysis tools to maintain a clean, efficient, and distraction-free codebase.

Dead code refers to code that's present in your codebase but is never executed. It can lead to:

- Increased compilation times
- Confusion during development
- Misleading assumptions about functionality

ReScript’s language design allows for accurate and efficient dead code analysis using the **ReScript Code Analyzer**, available via the official VSCode extension.

### Prerequisites

- ReScript VSCode extension (v1.8.2 or higher)

### Activation

1. Open the Command Palette: `Cmd/Ctrl + P`
2. Run: `> ReScript: Start Code Analyzer`

### Deactivation

- Run: `> ReScript: Stop Code Analyzer` 
- Or click “Stop Code Analyzer” in the status bar

### Result

- The “Problems” pane populates with dead code warnings and suggestions.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Unused Record Fields**

```rescript
type useReturn = {
  items: array<item>,
  toggleItemChecked: string => unit, // ← Never used
  setCheckedOnItem: (string, bool) => unit,
  checkAll: unit => unit,
  uncheckAll: unit => unit,
}
```

Remove unused fields to simplify code.

### 2. **Unused Variant Cases**

```rescript
type textType =
  | Text(string)
  | TextWithIcon({icon: React.element, text: string})
  | Render(React.element) // ← Never constructed
```

Removing unused variants allows simplifying rendering logic.

### 3. **Unused Parts of State**

```rescript
type validationState = Idle | Invalid | Valid

type state = {
  oldPassword: string,
  newPassword: string,
  newPasswordRepeated: string,
  validationState: validationState, // ← Never read
}
```

Old validation logic might remain after refactors—clean it up.

### 4. **Unnecessary Interface Exposure**

```rescript
// DrilldownTarget.resi
MetricParam.parse // ← Never used
MetricParam.serialize // ← Never used
```

Keep interfaces minimal by removing unused exports.

### 5. **Unused Functions**

```rescript
let routerUrlToPath = ... // ← Never used
let routeUrlStartsWith = ... // ← Never used
```

Removing these often uncovers further unused logic.

### 6. **Unused Components**

Components never referenced in production should be removed, unless explicitly preserved.


## Keeping Some Dead Code

### Use `@dead` and `@live`

#### `@dead`

Suppresses warnings but notifies if code becomes alive again.

```rescript
type user = {
  name: string,
  @dead age: int,
}
```

#### `@live`

Permanently marks code as alive (no future warnings).

```rescript
@live
let getUserName = user => user.name
```

## Configuration

Add to your `rescript.json`:

```json
"reanalyze": {
  "analysis": ["dce"],
  "suppress": ["src/bindings", "src/stories", "src/routes"],
  "unsuppress": [],
  "transitive": false
}
```

### Options:

- **analysis**: Enables dead code analysis (`"dce"`)
- **suppress**: Silences reporting for paths (still analyzes)
- **unsuppress**: Re-enables reports within suppressed paths
- **transitive**: Controls reporting of indirectly dead code

**Recommendation:** Set `transitive: false` for incremental cleanup.

## Summary

ReScript’s dead code analyzer helps you:

- Incrementally clean up your codebase
- Avoid confusion and complexity
- Improve long-term maintainability

Use it regularly for the best results.
