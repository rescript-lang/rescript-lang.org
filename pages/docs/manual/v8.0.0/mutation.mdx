# Mutation

ReScript has great traditional imperative & mutative programming capabilities. You should use these features sparingly, but sometimes they allow your code to be more performant and written in a more familiar pattern.

## Mutate Let-binding

Let-bindings are immutable, but you can wrap it with a `ref`, exposed as a record with a single mutable field in the standard library:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let myValue = ref(5);
```

```ml
let myValue = ref 5
```

```js
var myValue = {
  contents: 5,
}
```

</CodeTab>

## Usage

You can get the actual value of a `ref` box through accessing its `contents` field:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
let five = myValue.contents; // 5
```

```ml
let five = myValue.contents (* 5 *)
```

```js
var five = myValue.contents
```

</CodeTab>

We provide a syntax shortcut for `myValue.contents`: `myValue^`. Though we no longer encourage it.

Assign a new value to `myValue` like so:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
myValue.contents = 6;
```

```ml
myValue.contents = 6
```

```js
myValue.contents = 6
```

</CodeTab>

We provide a syntax sugar for this:

<CodeTab labels={["Reason (Old Syntax)", "ML (Older Syntax)", "JS Output"]}>

```re
myValue := 6;
```

```ml
myValue := 6
```

```js
myValue.contents = 6
```

</CodeTab>

Note that the previous binding `five` stays `5`, since it got the underlying item on the `ref` box, not the `ref` itself.

**Note**: you might see in the JS output tabs above that `ref` allocates an object. Worry not; local, non-exported `ref`s allocations are optimized away.

## Tip & Tricks

Before reaching for `ref`, know that you can achieve lightweight, local "mutations" through [overriding let bindings](let-binding.md#binding-shadowing).
