# Migrate to ReScript 12

## Recommended Migration

### Prerequisites

- ReScript V11 project.
- Uncurried mode must be enabled (i.e. you have not opted-out from it)
- Your project must not contain any OCaml source code anymore, as support for `.ml` files is removed in this version. However there are ways to convert OCaml syntax with an older ReScript compiler version (see below).
- The old configuration filename that was deprecated in v11, `bsconfig.json`, is removed. Rename it to `rescript.json`.
- Minimum supported Node.js version is 20.0.0

### Standard library changes

In V12, the new standard library ships with the compiler, so you can uninstall and remove the `@rescript/core` dependency from your `rescript.json`

```console
$ npm remove @rescript/core
```

```diff
 {
   "bs-dependencies": [
-    "@rescript/core"
   ]
 }
```

Also remove auto opening of `RescriptCore`.

```diff
 {
   "bsc-flags": [
-    "-open RescriptCore",
   ]
 }
```

if you had `@rescript/std` installed, remove it as well:

```shell
npm uninstall @rescript/std
```

this is replaced by `@rescript/runtime`, which is a installed as a dependency of `rescript` now.

## Replacements

Some typical name changes include:

`Error.t` -> `JsError.t`
`raise(MyException("error"))` -> `throw(MyException("error"))`
`Js.Exn.Error` exception -> `JsExn`
`Error.make` -> `JsExn.make`
`Error.raise` -> `JsExn.raise`
`Error.message` -> `JsExn.message`
`Bool.fromStringExn("true")` -> `Bool.fromStringOrThrow("true")`
`Int.Bitwise.lsl` -> `Int.shiftLeft`

Tip: You can use the migration tool to automatically replace these with the new functions.

```shell
npx rescript-tools migrate-all <root>

# preview the changes via
rescript-tools migrate <file> [--stdout]
```

### Bitwise operations

v11:

```res
let x = ~a        // bitwise NOT
let y = a ^ b     // bitwise XOR
let z = a & b     // bitwise AND
let w = a | b     // bitwise OR
```

v12:

```res
let x = ~~~a      // bitwise NOT
let y = a ^^^ b   // bitwise XOR
let z = a &&& b   // bitwise AND
let w = a ||| b   // bitwise OR
```

### JSX children spread

v11:

```res
<div> ...children </div>
```

v12:

```res
<div> {...children} </div>
```

### Attributes

v11:

```res
@bs.as("foo")
@bs.send
@bs.new
@raises
@genType.as
```

v12:

```res
@as("foo")
@send
@new
@throws
@as
```

- `@meth` and `@bs.send.pipe` are removed.

### Assert

v11:

```res
assert 1 == 2
```

v12:

```res
assert(1 == 2)  // Now a regular function call
```

## Configuration

Rename `bsconfig.json` to `rescript.json` and update these configuration options:

- `bs-dependencies` → `dependencies`
- `bs-dev-dependencies` → `dev-dependencies`
- `bsc-flags` → `compiler-flags`

### jsx

- Set `version` to `4` (lower versions are not supported)
- Remove `mode` option (automatically set to `automatic`)

## Build System Changes

The build system has been completely rewritten in v12.0.0.

In v11, we had:

```shell
# build
rescript build

# watch build
rescript build -w

# format
rescript format -all
```

in v12, this becomes:

```shell
# build
rescript

# watch build
rescript watch

# format
rescript format
```
