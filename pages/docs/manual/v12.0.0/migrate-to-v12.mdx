# Migrate to ReScript 12

## Recommended Migration

### Prerequisites

- ReScript V11 project.
- Uncurried mode must be enabled (i.e. you have not opted-out from it)
- Your project must not contain any OCaml source code anymore, as support for `.ml` files is removed in this version. However there are ways to convert OCaml syntax with an older ReScript compiler version (see below).
- The old configuration filename that was deprecated in v11, `bsconfig.json`, is removed. Rename it to `rescript.json`.

### Standard library changes

In V12, the new standard library ships with the compiler, so you can uninstall and remove the `@rescript/core` dependency from your `rescript.json`

```console
$ npm remove @rescript/core
```

```diff
 {
   "bs-dependencies": [
-    "@rescript/core"
   ]
 }
```

Also remove auto opening of `RescriptCore`.

```diff
 {
   "bsc-flags": [
-    "-open RescriptCore",
   ]
 }
```

## Replacements

Some typical name changes include:

`Error.t` -> `JsError.t`
`raise(` ->  `throw(`
`Js.Exn.Error` exception -> `JsExn`
`Error.make` -> `JsExn.make`
`Error.raise` -> `JsExn.raise`
`Error.message` -> `JsExn.message` 
 `Int.Bitwise.lsl` -> `Int.shiftLeft`
