# Introduction

## Stdlib

[Stdlib](api/stdlib) is ReScript's new standard library. It replaces the complete `Js` module as well as some of the more frequently used modules from `Belt` and is recommended to use with uncurried mode.

In ReScript 11, it was shipped as a separate npm package `@rescript/core`.

Since Rescript 12, it is now included with the `rescript` npm package itself.

## Additional Libraries

ReScript ships with these two additional modules in its standard library:

- [Belt](api/belt): immutable collections and extra helpers not available in JavaScript / [Stdlib](api/stdlib).
- [Dom](api/dom): Dom related types and modules. Contains our standardized types used by various userland DOM bindings.

## Legacy Modules

The [Js](api/js) module is superseded by [Stdlib](api/stdlib).
