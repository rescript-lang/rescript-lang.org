# Lazy Value

If you have some expensive computations you'd like to **defer and cache** subsequently, you can turn them into *lazy* values:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res prelude
@module("node:fs")
external readdirSync: string => array<string> = "readdirSync"

// Read the directory, only once
let expensiveFilesRead = Lazy.make(() => {
  Console.log("Reading dir")
  readdirSync("./pages")
})
```
```js
import * as Lazy from "./stdlib/Lazy.js";
import * as Nodefs from "node:fs";

let expensiveFilesRead = Lazy.make(() => {
  console.log("Reading dir");
  return Nodefs.readdirSync("./pages");
});

```

</CodeTab>

**Note**: a lazy value is **not** a [shared data type](shared-data-types.md). Don't rely on its runtime representation in your JavaScript code.

## Execute The Lazy Computation

To actually run the lazy value's computation, use `Lazy.get` from the standard library `Lazy` module:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
// First call. The computation happens
Console.log(Lazy.get(expensiveFilesRead)) // logs "Reading dir" and the directory content

// Second call. Will just return the already calculated result
Console.log(Lazy.get(expensiveFilesRead)) // logs the directory content
```
```js
console.log(Lazy.get(expensiveFilesRead));

console.log(Lazy.get(expensiveFilesRead));
```

</CodeTab>

The first time `Lazy.get` is called, the expensive computation happens and the result is **cached**. The second time, the cached value is directly used.

**You can't re-trigger the computation after the first `get` call**. Make sure you only use a lazy value with computations whose results don't change (e.g. an expensive server request whose response is always the same).

## Exception Handling

For completeness' sake, our files read example might throw an exception because of `readdirSync`. Here's how you'd handle it:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res example
let result = try {
  Lazy.get(expensiveFilesRead)
} catch {
| Not_found => [] // empty array of files
}
```
```js
let result;

try {
  result = Lazy.get(expensiveFilesRead);
} catch (raw_exn) {
  let exn = Primitive_exceptions.internalToException(raw_exn);
  if (exn.RE_EXN_ID === "Not_found") {
    result = [];
  } else {
    throw exn;
  }
}
```

</CodeTab>

Though you should probably handle the exception inside the lazy computation itself.
