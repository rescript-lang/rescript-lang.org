# Installation

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version >= 20
- One of the following package managers:
  - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/) (comes with Node.js)
  - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
    - yarn versions >1 need to set `nodeLinker: node-modules` in `.yarnrc.yml`
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
  - [bun](https://bun.sh/)
  - [deno](http://deno.com/)
    - Configure `"nodeModulesDir": "auto"` in `deno.json`

## New Project

The fastest and easiest way to spin up a new ReScript project is with the [create-rescript-app](https://github.com/rescript-lang/create-rescript-app) project generator. This will get you started with a fresh Next.js or Vite app with React and Tailwind CSS.

You can start it with any of the aforementioned package managers or `npx`.

<CodeTab labels={["npm", "npx", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>

```sh example
npm create rescript-app@latest
```

```sh
npx create-rescript-app
```

```sh
yarn create rescript-app
```

```sh
pnpm create rescript-app
```

```sh
bun create rescript-app
```

</CodeTab>

- Follow the steps of the setup.
- Trigger a ReScript build:
  ```sh
  npm run res:build
  ```
- If you selected the "basic" template, simply run it with:
  ```sh
  node src/Demo.res.mjs
  ```

That compiles your ReScript into JavaScript, then uses Node.js to run said JavaScript.

**When taking your first steps with ReScript, we recommend you use our unique workflow of keeping a tab open for the generated JS file** (`.res.js`/`.res.mjs`), so that you can learn how ReScript transforms into JavaScript. Not many languages output clean JavaScript code you can inspect and learn from! With our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode), use the command "ReScript: Open the compiled JS file for this implementation file" to open the generated JS file for the currently active ReScript source file.

During development, instead of running `npm run res:build` each time to compile, use `npm run res:dev` to start a watcher that recompiles automatically after file changes.

## Integrate Into an Existing JS Project

If you already have a JavaScript project into which you'd like to add ReScript you can do that in the following ways:

### Quick Setup

In the root directory of your project, execute:

<CodeTab labels={["npm", "npx", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>

```sh
npm create rescript-app@latest
```

```sh
npx create-rescript-app
```

```sh
yarn create rescript-app
```

```sh
pnpm create rescript-app
```

```sh
bun create rescript-app
```

</CodeTab>

`create-rescript-app` will tell you that a `package.json` file has been detected and ask you if it should install ReScript into your project. Just follow the steps accordingly.

### Manual Setup

- Install ReScript locally:

  <CodeTab labels={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun", "deno"]}>

  ```sh
  npm install rescript
  ```

  ```sh
  yarn add rescript
  ```

  ```sh
  pnpm install rescript
  ```

  ```sh
  bun install rescript
  ```

  ```sh
  // you will need deno configured to have a node_modules folder
  deno install npm:rescript --allow-scripts
  ```

  </CodeTab>

- Create a ReScript build configuration file (called `rescript.json`) at the root:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "your-project-name",
    "sources": [
      {
        "dir": "src", // update this to wherever you're putting ReScript files
        "subdirs": true
      }
    ],
    "package-specs": [
      {
        "module": "esmodule",
        "in-source": true
      }
    ],
    "suffix": ".res.js"
  }
  ```
  See [Build Configuration](build-configuration) for more details on `rescript.json`.
- Add convenience `npm` scripts to `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "res:build": "rescript",
    "res:dev": "rescript -w"
  }
  ```

Since ReScript compiles to clean readable JS files, the rest of your existing toolchain (e.g. Vite, Rspack, Rollup) should just work!

### Integrate with a ReactJS Project

To start a [rescript-react](/docs/react/latest/introduction) app, or to integrate ReScript into an existing ReactJS app, follow the instructions [here](/docs/react/latest/installation).
