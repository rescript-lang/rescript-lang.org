# Editor

This section is about the editor plugin for ReScript. It adds syntax highlighting, autocomplete, type hints, formatting, code navigation, code analysis for `.res` and `.resi` files.


## Plugins

- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-sublime)
- [Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/rescript-lang/vim-rescript)

### Community Supported

- [IDEA](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reasonml-idea-plugin)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/jjlee/rescript-mode)


## Code analysis

The code analysis provides extra checks for your ReScript project, such as detecting dead code and unhandled exceptions. It's powered by [reanalyze](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), which is built into the extension—no separate install required.

### How to Use

- Open the command palette and run:  
  `ReScript: Start Code Analyzer`
- Warnings like dead code will show inline in the editor.
- Suppression actions are available where applicable.
- To stop analysis, click **Stop Code Analyzer** in the status bar.

### Configuration

Add a `reanalyze` section to your `rescript.json` to control what the analyzer checks or ignores. You’ll get autocomplete for config options in the editor.  
More details: [reanalyze config docs](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze#configuration-via-bsconfigjson)

### Guide

Look [here](editor-code-analysis) for a more detailed guide about how to use the code analysis tool.

### Caveats

- Doesn't support cross-package dead code analysis in monorepos. Run it per package instead.
