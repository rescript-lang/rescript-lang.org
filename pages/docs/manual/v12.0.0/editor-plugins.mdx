# Editor

This section is about the editor plugin for ReScript. It adds syntax highlighting, autocomplete, type hints, formatting, code navigation, code analysis for `.res` and `.resi` files.


## Plugins

- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-sublime)
- [Vim/Neovim](https://github.com/rescript-lang/vim-rescript)

### Community Supported

We don't officially support these; use them at your own risk!

- [Neovim Tree-sitter](https://github.com/nkrkv/nvim-treesitter-rescript)
- [IDEA](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reasonml-idea-plugin)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/jjlee/rescript-mode)


## Code analysis

The code analysis provides extra checks for your ReScript project, such as detecting dead code and unhandled exceptions. It's powered by [reanalyze](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze), which is built into the extension — no separate install required.

### How to Use

- Open the command palette and run:  
  `ReScript: Start Code Analyzer`
- Warnings like dead code will show inline in the editor.
- Suppression actions are available where applicable.
- To stop analysis, click **Stop Code Analyzer** in the status bar.

### Configuration

Add a `reanalyze` section to your `rescript.json` to control what the analyzer checks or ignores. You’ll get autocomplete for config options in the editor.  
More details: [reanalyze config docs](https://github.com/rescript-association/reanalyze#configuration-via-bsconfigjson)

### Guide

Look [here](editor-code-analysis) for a more detailed guide about how to use the code analysis tool.

### Caveats

- Doesn't support cross-package dead code analysis in monorepos. Run it per package instead.

## Editor features
Below are features and configurations of the editor tooling that might be good to know about.

### Pipe completions
Pipes (`->`) are a huge and important part of the ReScript language, for many reasons. Because of that, extra care has gone into the editor experience for using pipes.

#### Default pipe completion rules for non-builtin types
By default, using `->` will give completions from the module where the type of the expression you're piping on is defined. So, if you're piping on something of the type `SomeModule.t` (like `someValue->`) then you'll get completions for all functions defined in `SomeModule` that take the type `t` as the first unlabelled argument.

#### Pipe completions for builtin types
For builtin types, completion will automatically happen based on the _standard library module_ for that type. So, `array` types will get completions from the `Array` module, `string` gets completions from `String`, and so on.

There is a way to enhance this behavior via configuration, described further down in this document.

### Dot completion enhancements
In ReScript, using a dot (`.`) normally means "access record field". But, because using `.` to trigger completions is so pervasive in for example JavaScript, we extend `.` to trigger completions in more scenarios than just for record field access.

This behavior has the following important implications:
- Improves discoverability (E.g. using a `.` will reveal important pipe completions)
- Enables a more natural completion flow for people used to JavaScript, where dots power more completions naturally

Below is a list of all the scenarios where using dots trigger completion in addition to the normal record field completion.

#### Objects
When writing a `.` on something that's a [structural object](object.md), you'll get completions for those object properties. Example:
```res
let obj = {
  "first": true,
  "second": false
}

let x = obj.

// Will give the following completions for object property access:
// - ["first"]
// - ["second"]
```

#### Pipe completions for anything
When writing `.` on _anything_, the editor will try to do pipe completion for the value on the left of the `.`. Example:

```res
let arr = [1, 2, 3]

let x = arr.

// Will give the following pipe completions:
// - ->Array.length
// - ->Array.filter
// - ->Array.map
```

### `@editor.completeFrom` for drawing completions from additional modules
You can configure any type you have control over to draw pipe completions from additional modules, in addition to the main module where the type is defined, via the `@editor.completeFrom` decorator. This is useful in many different scenarios:

* When you, for various reasons, need to have your type definition separate from its "main module". Could be because of cyclic dependencies, a need for the type to be in a recursive type definition chain, and so on.
* You have separate modules with useful functions for your type but that you don't want to (or can't) include in the main module of that type.

Let's look at an example:
```res
// Types.res
// In this example types need to live separately in their own file, for various reasons
type htmlInput

// Utils.res
module HtmlInput = {
  /** Gets the HTML input value. */
  @get
  external value: Types.htmlInput => option<string> = "value"
}
```

In the example above, if we try and pipe on something of the type `Types.htmlInput`, we'll get no completions because there are no functions in `Types` that take `htmlInput` as its first unlabelled argument. But, better DX would be for the editor to draw completions from our util functions for `htmlInput` in the `Utils.HtmlInput` module.

With `@editor.completeFrom`, we can fix this. Let's look at an updated example:
```res
// Types.res
@editor.completeFrom(Utils.HtmlInput)
type htmlInput

// Utils.res
module HtmlInput = {
  /** Gets the HTML input value. */
  @get
  external value: Types.htmlInput => option<string> = "value"
}
```

Now when piping on a value of the type `Types.htmlInput`, the editor tooling will know to include relevant functions from the module `Utils.HtmlInput`, and you'll get the completions you expect, even if the functions aren't located in the same module.

> You can point out multiple modules to draw completions from for a type either by repeating `@editor.completeFrom` with a single module path each time, or by passing an array with all the module paths you want to include, like `@editor.completeFrom([Utils.HtmlInput, HtmlInputUtils])`.

### Configuring the editor via `editor` in `rescript.json`
There's certain configuration you can do for the editor on a per project basis in `rescript.json`. Below lists all of the configuration available.

#### `autocomplete` for pipe completion
The `autocomplete` property of `editor` in `rescript.json` let's you map types to modules _on the project level_ that you want the editor to leverage when doing autocomplete for pipes. 

This is useful in scenarios like:
* You have your own util module(s) for builtin types. Maybe you have an `ArrayExtra` with helpers for arrays that you want to get completions from whenever dealing with arrays.
* You have your own util module(s) for types you don't control yourself (and therefore can't use `@editor.completeFrom`), like from external packages you install.

To configure, you pass `autocomplete` an object where the keys are the _path to the type_ you want to target, and then an array of the path to each module you want to include for consideration for pipe completions.

Let's take two examples.

##### Enhancing completion for builtin types
First, let's look at including our own `ArrayExtra` in all completions for `array`:
```json
{
  "editor": {
    "autocomplete": {
      "array": ["ArrayExtra"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, when using pipes on arrays, you'll get completions both from the standard library array functions, and also from your own `ArrayExtra` module.
```res
let x = [1, 2, 3]->

// Example of what completing at the pipe might look like
- Array.length
- Array.map
- Array.filter
- ArrayExtra.someArrayFn
- ArrayExtra.myOtherArrayFn
```

##### Enhancing completion for non-builtin types
Now, let's look at an example of when you have a non-builtin type that you don't have control over.

In this example, imagine this:
* We're writing an app using `fastify`
* We're using an external package that provides the necessary bindings in a `Fastify` module
* We've got our own extra file `FastifyExtra` that has various custom util functions that operate on the main type `Fastify.t`

We now want the editor to always suggest completions from the `FastifyExtra` module, in addition to the regular completions from the main `Fastify` module.

Let's configure this using the `editor.autocomplete` config in `rescript.json`:

```json
{
  "editor": {
    "autocomplete": {
      "Fastify.t": ["FastifyExt"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, when using pipes on anything of type `Fastify.t`, we'll also get completions from our custom `FastifyExtra`.
