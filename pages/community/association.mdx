# The ReScript Association

The ReScript Association is dedicated to the development and support of the ReScript programming language

ReScript is a programming language for building complex JavaScript applications and user interfaces. It was designed for professional JavaScript and TypeScript developers, and integrates seamlessly in existing JavaScript projects for gradual adoption.

Goal of ReScript is to provide a viable alternative to gradually typed languages, such as TypeScript. The type system was derived from the OCaml programming language, and refined for JavaScript usage.

It provides one of the fastest compile-to-JS compilation and build toolchain in the JavaScript ecosystem available today.

> ReScript is a robustly typed language that compiles to efficient and human-readable JavaScript.

The ReScript Association provides a legal and financial foundation for Open Source related work within the ReScript project. It takes ownership of essential language infrastructure and is responsible for outside communication to industrial ReScript users, partners and donors.

The organization is non-profit oriented. All its work is independently funded by industrial partners / research institutions / individuals, and openly accessible to the public.
