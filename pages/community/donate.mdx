# Donate

Donations will help the ReScript project to maintain and improve the platform and to provide our users with a more accessible ReScript ecosystem.

The ReScript language, its tooling and docmentation, are fully developed by the community. Thus, we rely on donations from organizations and individuals to stay independent. Additional financial resources help us to maintain essential language infrastructure (e.g. rescript-lang.org, syntax, editor-tooling), and to organize events, like the [annual ReScript Retreat](/blog/retreats).

It also enables us to fund important Open Source projects within the ReScript ecosystem.

## How to Donate?

For now we only support SEPA transfers.
