summary: "This is the `@raises` decorator."
category: "decorators"
status: "deprecated"
---

> Deprecated since v12.0.0. Use the [@throws](/syntax-lookup#throws-decorator) decorator instead.

> This decorator requires [`reanalyze`](https://github.com/rescript-lang/reanalyze), a code analysis tool for ReScript, to be installed. [Click here to read about how you get started with reanalyze.](/docs/manual/v12.0.0/editor-plugins#code-analysis).

`@raises` is picked up by reanalyze's exception analysis, and acknowledges that a function can throw exceptions that are not caught, and suppresses a warning in that case. Callers of the functions are then subjected to the same rule. Example `@raises(Exn)` or `@raises([E1, E2, E3])` for multiple exceptions.
