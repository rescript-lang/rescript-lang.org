A `spread` is three dots in a row: `...`. Spreads have many different uses in ReScript depending on in which context it is used.
## Record definitions
> Available in v10+

Spreads can be used to copy fields from one record definition into another. 

```res
type a = {
  id: string,
  name: string,
}

type b = {
  age: int
}

type c = {
  ...a,
  ...b,
  active: bool
}
```

## Record immutable update
Spreads can be used for immutable updates of records:

```res
let meNextYear = {...me, age: me.age + 1}
```

## Variant definitions
> Available in v11+

Spreads can be used to copy constructors from one variant definition to another.

```res
type a = One | Two | Three
type b = | ...a | Four | Five
// b is now One | Two | Three | Four | Five
```

## Variant pattern matching
> Available in v12+

You can refine the type of a variant by spreading compatible a variant when pattern matching:
```res
type pets = Cat | Dog
type fish = Cod | Salmon
type animals = | ...pets | ...fish

let isPet = (animal: animals) => {
  switch animal {
  | ...dog => Console.log("A dog!")
  | _ => Console.log("Not a dog...")
  }
}

```

## Partial application of functions
> Available in v11+ (uncurried mode)

You can partially apply a function using the spread syntax. Partially applying a function will return a new function taking only the arguments that wasn't applied partially.

```res
let add = (a, b) => a + b
let addFive = add(5, ...)
```
