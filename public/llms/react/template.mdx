# Documentation for LLMs

We adhere to the [llms.txt convention](https://llmstxt.org/) to make documentation accessible to large language models and their applications.

Currently, we have the following files...

- [/docs/react/llms.txt](/llms/react/<VERSION>/llms.txt) — a list of the available files for ReScript React.
- [/docs/react/llms-full.txt](/llms/react/<VERSION>/llm-full.txt) — complete documentation for ReScript React.
- [/docs/react/llms-small.txt](/llms/react/<VERSION>/llm-small.txt) — compressed version of the former, without examples for ReScript React.

...and the language documentation:

- [/docs/manual/llms](/docs/manual/llms) — the LLms documentation for ReScript.

## Notes

- The content is automatically generated from the same source as the official documentation for the specific version
