summary: "This is the `mod` operator (remainder semantics)."
category: "operators-arithmetic"
---

The `%` operator has `mod` naming in ReScript, but its semantics are _remainder_ (like JavaScript `%`).

It supports `int`, `float`, and `bigint`.

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let result = %(7, 4)
```

```js
var result = 3;
```

</CodeTab>
