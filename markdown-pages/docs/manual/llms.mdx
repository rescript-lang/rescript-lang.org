# Documentation for LLMs

We adhere to the [llms.txt convention](https://llmstxt.org/) to make documentation accessible to large language models and their applications.

Currently, we have the following files...

- [/manual/llms.txt](/llms/manual/llms.txt) — a list of the available files for ReScript language.
- [/manual/llm-full.txt](/llms/manual/llm-full.txt) — complete documentation for ReScript language.
- [/manual/llm-small.txt](/llms/manual/llm-small.txt) — compressed version of the former, without examples.

...and package-level documentation:

- [/react/llms](../react/llms.mdx) — the LLms documentation for ReScript React.

## Notes

- The content is automatically generated from the same source as the official documentation for the specific version
