# Introduction

## Stdlib

[Stdlib](/docs/manual/api/stdlib) is ReScript's new builtin standard library.
It will cover just about you need for day-to-day programming in ReScript and covers most of the built in JavaScript API.

## Additional Libraries

ReScript ships with these two additional modules in its standard library:

- [Belt](/docs/manual/api/belt): immutable collections and extra helpers not available in JavaScript / [Stdlib](/docs/manual/api/stdlib).
- [Dom](/docs/manual/api/stdlibdom): Dom related types and modules. Contains our standardized types used by various userland DOM bindings.
