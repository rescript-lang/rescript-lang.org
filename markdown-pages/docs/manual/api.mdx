# Introduction

## Stdlib

[Stdlib](/docs/manual/api/stdlib) is ReScript's new standard library. It replaces the complete `Js` module as well as some of the more frequently used modules from `Belt` and is recommended to use with uncurried mode.

In ReScript 11, it was shipped as a separate npm package `@rescript/core`.

Since Rescript 12, it is now included with the `rescript` npm package itself.

## Additional Libraries

ReScript ships with these two additional modules in its standard library:

- [Belt](/docs/manual/api/belt): immutable collections and extra helpers not available in JavaScript / [Stdlib](/docs/manual/api/stdlib).
- [Dom](/docs/manual/api/stdlibdom): Dom related types and modules. Contains our standardized types used by various userland DOM bindings.
